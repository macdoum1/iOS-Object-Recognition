 @method authorizeUserForScopes:delegate:
 @abstract Allows the user to login and, if necessary, authorize the application for the requested scopes.
 
 @param scopes The profile scopes that the application is requesting from the user. The first scope must be "profile".  "postal_code" is an optional second scope.
 @param authenticationDelegate A delegate implementing the @link //apple_ref/occ/intf/AIAuthenticationDelegate @/link protocol to receive success and failure messages.
 
 @discussion Use this method to request authorization from the user for the required scopes.  If the user has not logged in, they will see a login page.  Afterward, if they have not previously approved these scopes for your application, they will see a consent page.
 
    The sign in page is displayed in the Safari web browser, so there will be a visible switch from the application to the Safari browser. After the user signs in on the browser, they are redirected back to the app. The application must define the application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation application delegate and call the @link handleOpenURL:sourceApplication: @/link API from that delegate. This allows the SDK to get the login information from the Safari web browser.
 
 Scopes that can be used with this API are:
 1.  "profile": This scope enables an application to request profile information from the backend server. The porfile information includes cusomter's name, email and user_id.
 
 2.  "postal_code": This scope enables an application to request the postal code registered to the user's account.
 
 @result Pass in a valid instance of @link //apple_ref/occ/intf/AIAuthenticationDelegate @/link to receive success and failure notifications.
 
 If authorization succeeds the @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/requestDidSucceed: @/link method is called on the delegate.  The application can now call @link getProfile: @/link to retrieve the user's profile data, or @link getAccessTokenForScopes:withOverrideParams:delegate: @/link to retrieve the raw access token.
 
 If authorization fails the @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/requestDidFail: @/link method is called on the delegate.  The error code and an error message are passed to the method in an APIError object.  authorizeUserForScopes can produce the following error codes:
 
 1.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAIUnauthorizedClient @/link - The application is not authorized to make this call.
 
 2.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAIInternalError @/link - An internal error occured in the SDK.  You can allow the user to login again.
 
 3.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAIErrorUserInterrupted @/link - The user canceled the login page.  You can allow the user to login again.
 
 4.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAIInvalidInput @/link - One of the API parameters is invalid.  See the error message for more information.
 
 5.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAIDeviceError @/link -  The SDK encountered an error on the device.  Currently, the SDK only throws this error when it receives the same error from the keychain service. Calling @link clearAuthorizationState: @/link will help.
 
 6.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAINetworkError @/link - A network error occurred, possibly due to the user being offline.
 
 7.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAIServerError @/link - The server encountered an error while completing the request, or the SDK received an unknown response from the server.  You can allow the user to login again.
 
 8.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAIAccessDenied @/link - The user did not consent to the requested scopes.

 @param scopes The profile scopes required for the token. The first scope must be "profile".  "postal_code" is an optional second scope.
 @param authenticationDelegate A delegate implementing the @link //apple_ref/occ/intf/AIAuthenticationDelegate @/link protocol to receive success and failure messages.
 @param overrideParams Any additional override parameters, as key:value pairs. The SDK currently supports the following override flags:
 
 kForceRefresh - Forces the SDK to refesh the cached access token. See @link kForceRefresh @/link for more information.
 
 @discussion This method returns a valid access token, if necessary by exchanging the current refresh token for a new access token.  If the method is successful, this access token is valid for the requested scopes.
 
    If the API is called with the @link kForceRefresh @/link override property set to "YES", the SDK discards the existing access token and requests a new access token.
 
 @result
 Pass in a valid instance of @link //apple_ref/occ/intf/AIAuthenticationDelegate @/link to receive success and failure notifications.
 
 If authorization succeeds the @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/requestDidSucceed: @/link method is called on the delegate.  The new access token is passed in the result property of the APIResult parameter.  The application can then use the access token directly with services that support it.
 
 If authorization fails the @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/requestDidFail: @/link method is called on the delegate. The error code and an error message are passed to the method in an APIError object.  getAccessTokenForScopes can produce the following error codes:
 
 1.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAIApplicationNotAuthorized @/link - The application is not authorized for scopes requested. Call authorizeUserForScopes to allow the user to authorize the application.
 
 2.  @link //apple_ref/doc/anysymbol/kAIUnauthorizedClient @/link - The application is not authorized to make this call.

 @discussion This method handles the application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation call from the Safari web browser. The application should be calling this function when it receives a call to application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation, passing in the url and the sourceApplication.

    The SDK validates the url parameter to check if the url is valid for the SDK. It is possible the application may want to handle the url as well, in which case the application should first call the SDK to see if this url is a callback from safari and if the SDK wants to process it. After processing, the SDK will return its preference and the application can then process the url if it chooses.
